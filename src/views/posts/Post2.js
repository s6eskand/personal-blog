                        Fishing is no easy task. You have to use the right bait, cast the line properly, be able to
                        pick up the slightest of movements, and fight to pull the fish out of the water. <br/>

                        Just as you are reading this post, I was incredibly disappointed that React hooks had nothing to
                        do with fishing, and everything to do with React. However, React hooks are a great way to write
                        React Components inside a function while still using props, state, and other class based features
                        in a much cleaner and less verbose fashion<br/>

                            So what exactly are hooks? <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            In React, hooks are simply methods that allow you to create React Components without writing a class.
                            This alleviates the need for constructors, and the annoying <code>this.</code> that you have to append
                            to any property of the class. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll be investigating
                            the <code>useState()</code> and <code>useEffect()</code> hooks since those are all we need to
                            get started with React hooks and complete this project.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                        </p>
                        <p id="useState">
                            <b>The <code>useState()</code> Hook</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Consider the following example. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <Gist id="fce8439398fae492e97f05777bd9f0e2" /> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This is a simple component that contains a button that will change the content in our h1 tag by updating the Component
                            level state. The <code>useState()</code> method replaces initializing data in <code>this.state</code> as
                            well as the need for a constructor, and our predefined method <code>incrementCount()</code> replaces
                            the need for <code>this.setState()</code>.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            To use state with hooks, simply define a constant array with two elements, the first being your
                            state variable, and the second being the method that will handle any changes to the state. Next,
                            you'll set the initial state for that particular variable using the <code>useState()</code> hook,
                            passing in the initial value as a parameter. You are also not limited to only one state variable per
                            component, just add more variables within the function, declared in the same way as defined above and
                            you are good to go. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>Some Key Differences</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Although <code>useState()</code> replaces the <code>this.setState()</code> method, they are not the
                            same. In a Class, setting the state merges the updated variable with the rest of the existing state.
                            So if you have a <code>Dog</code> object with keys, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>breed</code> and
                            you only want to change age of the Dog, using <code>this.setState()</code>, all you have to
                            do is update the <code>age</code> value, which will look like this, <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <code>this.setState(&#123; age: this.state.age + 1 &#125;)</code> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            With hooks, <code>useState()</code> completely replaces the state property without merging. This
                            means that to update one property of your <code>Dog</code> object you have to update all the properties,
                            or else you will be left with a lonely Dog that has no name or breed, just an age. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <b>The <code>useEffect()</code> Hook</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Let's investigate another example <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <Gist id="5a1aebb1ac61b4931c959f8960681c4e" /> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                This time we are making use of the <code>useEffect()</code> hook which can replace
                                the <code>componentDidMount()</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>,
                                and <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> lifecycle methods we would use in a class Component. <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                In this context the word can is very important. Simply speaking, the reason why the <code>useEffect()</code> hook
                                and different React lifecycle methods are similar, are because they are simply side effects.
                                This means that they affect the state outside of its local environment. This usually refers to
                                making API calls, fetching data from a server, or changing the DOM in a React Component. For more
                                information on their differences, check out <a href="https://reacttraining.com/blog/useEffect-is-not-the-new-componentDidMount/">this article</a>. <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                This component fetches a random dog image using the <code>useEffect()</code> hook and
                                updates the displayed image using the <code>setImage()</code> method initialized by
                                the <code>useState()</code> hook. <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                The <code>useEffect()</code> hook accepts two parameters, a function, and an optional empty array.
                                The function we define within the hook will be what executes our task (in this case fetching a random
                                dog photo), and the empty array signifies that the <code>useEffect()</code> hook should only run after
                                the initial render of the page. By default, the <code>useEffect()</code> hook fires after
                                every single render, essentially making it the <code>componentDidMount()</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>,
                                and <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> lifecycle methods all into one. In this example, we only want
                                to load the image on the initial mount, so we add the empty array as a second parameter to prevent
                                unwanted updates.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <b>Note:</b> Try removing the array in the <code>useEffect()</code> hook and see how the data changes. <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                            </p>

                            <b>Component Properties</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Now we know how to handle Component level state using hooks, but what about props? <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <Gist id="374328fc4d20eece66c11cb7b90566aa" /> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            It's that simple. Just pass in <code>props</code> as a function parameter, and use props as
                            you normally would with any React Class, just remove the annoying <code>this.</code> that would
                            normally be there. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By comparing the two ways to write this component, the benefits of using hooks are evident.
                            By using hooks you have made the code not only easier to read and understand, but shortened the amount of time
                            it would take to develop. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Now let's take those simple concepts and apply them to a larger scale project. <br/>

                            <b>Hooks Law (without the springs)</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Hooks are great to use, but with any framework feature, they come with some rules. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>1. Hooks Can Only be Used at the Top Level</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>2. Only Call Hooks Within React Components or Custom Hooks</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This means that you cannot call a hook inside any sort of logic, meaning loops, conditional statements,
                            and nested functions. This is due to the fact that React needs to know the order that each hook
                            is called, in order to properly maintain the state between multiple Hook calls. If you are a free
                            spirit, and rules do not define you, consider using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks">es-lint-plugin</a> which
                            will reign you in, and enforce those rules during your development. More information on the Rules of Hooks can be found
                            in the official Facebook docs <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html">here</a>.<br/>

                                <p>&bull; Are well-versed in JavaScript</p>
                                <p>&bull; Some knowledge of React</p>
                            </div> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            First things first, we have to create our react app, there are different ways to do this, but
                            in this tutorial we'll be running the command <code>npx create-react-app react-hooks-intro</code>.
                            Once everything is set up, change directories into our new project and
                            run <code>npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css</code> so that we can make
                            a presentable frontend using Semantic UI (because React is a UI framework in the end).
                            In this tutorial we'll be using the pre built css themes from Semantic UI, if you would like to
                            customize your frontend, no need to use Semantic UI at all, but for this tutorial we'll be importing
                            the minified css file <code>import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';</code> in our <code>App.js</code> file<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Next, create a directory called <code>components</code> and create a JavaScript file
                            called <code>ListMovies.js</code> and another called <code>Movie.js</code>. We'll start by making
                            a reusable Card component with the help of Semantic UI in our <code>Movie.js</code> file. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b id="card">Creating the Card Component</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            In order to use this Component for all the movies we fetch from the API, we have to know what the card properties will be.
                            In this case we have the movie title, description, director, and the Rotten Tomatoes Score. We will
                            display the same image for each Card since the API doesn't provide an image.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            At this point our JavaScript file will look something like this <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <Gist id="56588618d11e561bae8124f27ff52136" /> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b id="list">Making the API Call</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The next step is to make the API call in our <code>ListMovies.js</code> file. To do this we'll be using the API given to us by our good friends
                            at <a href="https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/">the Studio Ghibli API</a>. The way this will be done is by creating
                            a state variable called <code>movies</code> that we will update using the <code>useState()</code> hook. The API call itself
                            will be done using the <code>useEffect()</code> hook, and the contents of the request will be mapped onto
                            the Cards we have already built to be displayed in an organized manner. Your <code>ListMovies</code> Component should
                            now look something like this <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <Gist id="2a7d374b70c69369740e1d985a920be0" /> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            If you use the same styles as I do, your application should now look something like this <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <div className="image-container">
                                <div className="main-img">
                                    <img src={project} alt=""/>
                                </div>
                            </div> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <h2 id="Conclusion">Final Thoughts</h2> <br/>
                            So that's that, your first mini project using React hooks. Hopefully this tutorial helped you,
                            and gave you some practice using hooks. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Hooks are a great way to write React Components,
                            however, they are completely optional, and React has no plans on removing class based Components from the framework.
                            So if you are hesitant to refactor from classes to functions (as I was at first), there is no
                            need to stress.
