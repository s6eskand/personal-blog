                            After over a month of procrastination, I have finally brought myself to make this blog! <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I originally had the idea to start a technical blog because I document everything I learn.
                            If you were to go through my Github account you would quickly see that I have a lot of tutorial
                            projects that I use as reference for when I am building larger scale applications. So, I had the idea
                            to share those resources. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Every single post will be a tutorial on a way to execute a task with a specific language or framework,
                            or just getting you set up with a specific language or framework. However, the learning doesn't stop there. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            With every tutorial/article on this blog, will be a link to the fully documented (yay commenting!) and completed project.
                            These projects will all be in one repository on my Github account that can be found <a style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}} href="https://github.com/s6eskand/learn-with-me">here</a>. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            So feel free to star the repo, use it as reference, or just copy and paste some of the boilerplate code needed to complete the project. I hope that I can help as much as possible with
                            any issues you may be facing, and thank you for reading this far <span role="img" aria-label="smiling emoji">&#128516;</span>
